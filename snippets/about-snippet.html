			<h1>About CNELab</h1>
			<p>CNELab is initially developed in the Clinical Neuroengineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Houston .
			</p>
			<h2>Development of CNELab</h2>
			<p>The core developer and maintainer of the CNELab software is <a href="http://www.tianxiaojiang.com" target="_blank">Tianxiao Jiang</a>. The idea of CNELab originates from another open-source software: <a href="http://biosigplot.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">BioSigPlot</a>, written by <a href="http://www.samuelboudet.com/" target="_blank">Samuel Boudet</a>. Based on it, CNELab has been gradually developed and enriched since 2014. Due to the explosion of new features, the original command line feature in BioSigPlot is not fully supported in CNELab. The current development of CNELab mainly focuses on the usability and stability of its GUI interface.</p>
